### Sad Smileys Canâ€™t Blink (Or Can They?)

Unlike the `Happy` smiley, the current implementation of the `Sad` smiley does not possess the ability to blink. Let's
first explore how blinking has been implemented in the Happy Smiley by examining the blink() method, which takes one
argument that determines the duration of the blink.

**Understanding Blink Mechanism:**

1. Does the code's author believe that every `Smiley` should be able to blink? Explain.

> Your answer here
>

2. For those smileys that blink, does the author expect them to blink in the same way? Explain.

> Your answer here
>

3. Referring to the implementation of blink in the Happy and Sad Smiley classes, give a brief explanation of what
   polymorphism is.

> Your answer here
>

4. How is inheritance used in the blink method, and why is it important for polymorphism?

> Your answer here
>

1. **Implement Blink in Sad Class:**

    - Create a new method called `blink` within the Sad class. Ensure you use the same method signature as in the Happy
      class:

   ```python
   def blink(self, delay=0.25):
       pass  # Replace 'pass' with your implementation
   ```

2. **Code Implementation:**

    - Implement the code that allows the Sad smiley to blink. Use the implementation from the Happy Smiley as a
      reference.
    - Ensure your new method functions similarly by controlling the blink duration through the `delay` argument.

3. **Testing the Implementation:**

   - Test the new blink functionality on your Raspberry Pi or within the Python classes provided. 
   - You might need to adjust the `main.py` script to incorporate Sad Smiley's new blinking capability.

Include a screenshot of the sad smiley or the modified `main.py`:

![Evidence of: Sad Smiley Blinking](screenshots/sad_blinking.png)

    - Observe and document the Sad smiley as it blinks its eyes. 
    - Describe any adjustments or issues encountered during implementation.

### If It Walks Like a Duckâ€¦

Previously, you implemented the blink functionality for the Sad smiley without utilizing the class `Blinkable`.

Assuming you did not use `Blinkable` (even if you actually did), consider how the Sad smiley could blink similarly to 
the Happy smiley without this specific class.

1. **Class Type Analysis:** 
 
    - What kind of class is `Blinkable`? Inspect its superclass for clues about its classification.

> Your answer here
> 

2. **Class Implementation:** 

    - `Blinkable` is a class intended to be implemented by other classes. 
    - What generic term describes this kind of class, which is designed for implementation by others? 
    - **Clue**: Notice the lack of any concrete implementation and the naming convention.

> Your answer here
>

3. **OO Principle Identification:** 

   - Regarding your answer to question (2), which Object-Oriented (OO) principle does this represent? 
   - Choose from the following and justify your answer in 1-2 sentences: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation.

> Your answer here
> 

4. **Implementation Flexibility:** 

    - Explain why you could grant the Sad Smiley a blinking feature similar to the Happy Smiley's implementation, even without directly using `Blinkable`.

> Your answer here
> 

5. **Concept and Language Specificity:** 

    - In relation to your response to question (4), what is this capability known as, and why is it feasible in Python and many other dynamically typed languages but not in most statically typed
       programming languages like C#? 
    - **Clue** This concept is hinted at in the title of this section.

## Refactoring

### Does a Smiley Have to Be Yellow?

While our current implementation predominantly features yellow smileys, emotional expressions like sickness or anger
typically utilize colors like green, red, or orange. 

We'll explore the feasibility of integrating these colors into our smileys.

1. **Defined Colors and Their Location:**

    a. Which colors are defined and in which class(s)?
    
    > Your answer here
    >

    b. What type of variables hold these colors? Are the values expected to change during the program's execution?
       Explain your answer.

    > Your answer here
    >

    c. Add the color blue to the appropriate class using the appropriate format and values.


2. **Usage of Color Variables:**

    a. In which classes are the color variables used?

    > Your answer here
    > 


3. **Simple Method to Change Colors:**

    a. What is the easiest way you can think to change the smileys to green? Easiest, not necessarily the best!

    > Your answer here
    > 


Here's a revised version of the "Flexible Colors â€“ Step 1" section for the smiley project, incorporating your
specifications for formatting and content updates:



### Flexible Colors â€“ Step 1

Changing the color of the smileys once is straightforward, but it isn't very flexible. 

To facilitate various colors for smileys, it is advisable not to hardcode values in any class. 

This approach was identified earlier as a necessary change. 

Let's start by removing the built-in assumptions about color in our classes.

1. **Add a method called `complexion` to the `Smiley` class:** 

   - Implement this instance method to return `self.YELLOW`.
   - Using the term "complexion" instead of "color" provides a more abstract terminology that focuses on the meaning
     rather than implementation.

2. **Refactor subclasses to use the `complexion` method:** 

   - Modify any subclass that directly accesses the color variable to instead utilize the new `complexion` method.
   - This ensures that color handling is centralized and can be easily modified in the future.

3. **Determine the applicable Object-Oriented principle:** 

   - Consider whether Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, or Encapsulation best applies to the modifications made in
     this step.

4. **Verify the implementation:** 

   - Ensure that the modifications function as expected.
   - The smileys should still display in yellow, confirming that the new method correctly replaces the direct color
     references.

This step is crucial for setting up a more flexible system for color management in the smiley display logic, allowing
for easy adjustments and extensions in the future.


### Flexible Colors â€“ Step 2

Having removed the hardcoded color values, we now enhance the base class to support dynamic color assignments more
effectively.

1. **Modify the `__init__()` method in the `Smiley` class:**

   - Introduce a default argument named `complexion` and assign `YELLOW` as its default value. 
   - This allows the instantiation of smileys with customizable colors.

2. **Introduce a new instance variable:**

   - Create a variable called `my_complexion` and assign the `complexion` parameter to it. 
   - This step ensures that each smiley instance can maintain its own color state.

3. **Rationale for `my_complexion`:**

    - Using a distinct instance variable like `my_complexion` avoids potential conflicts with the method parameter names
      and clarifies that it is an attribute specific to the object.

4. **Bulk rename:**

   - We want to update our grid to use the value of complexion, but we have so many `Y`'s in the
     grid.
   - Use your IDE's refactoring tool to rename all instances of the **symbol** `Y` to `X`, where `X` is the
     value of the `complexion` variable.
   - Include a screenshot evidencing you have found the correct refactor tool and the changes made.

![Evidence of: Bulk Rename](screenshots/bulk_rename.png)

5. **Update the `complexion` method:**

    - Adjust this method to return `self.my_complexion`, ensuring that whatever color is assigned during instantiation
      is what the smiley displays.

6. **Verification:**

   - Run the updated code to confirm that Smileys still defaults to yellow unless specified otherwise.

### Flexible Colors â€“ Step 3

With the foundational changes in place, it's now possible to implement varied smiley colors for different emotional
expressions.

1. **Adjust the `Sad` class initialization:** 

   - In the `Sad` class's initializer method, change the superclass call to include the `complexion` argument with the
     value `self.BLUE`, as shown:

```python
    super().__init__(complexion=self.BLUE)
```

2. **Test color functionality for the Sad smiley:** 

   - Execute the program to verify that the Sad smiley now appears blue.

3. **Ensure the Happy smiley remains yellow:** 

    - Confirm that changes to the Sad smiley do not affect the default color of the Happy smiley, which should still
      display in yellow.

5. **Design and Implement An Angry Smiley:** 

   - Create an Angry smiley class that inherits from the `Smiley` class. 
   - Set the color of the Angry smiley to red by passing `self.RED` as the `complexion` argument in the superclass call.
